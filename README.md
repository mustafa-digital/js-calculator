# js-calculator

## About

This is a simple calculator app written in JavaScript & HTML.
I used JavaScript to receive inputs from user click events, display changes to the calculator display, and do simple math operations using functions.
The UI and styling was done using TailwindCSS framework. I used the flex and grid tailwind classes to position elements, as well as other classes to add color, sizing, etc.
